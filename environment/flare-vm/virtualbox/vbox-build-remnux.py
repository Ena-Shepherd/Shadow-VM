DESCRIPTION = """
Automates the creation and export of customized REMnux virtual machines (VMs).
Begins by restoring a pre-existing "BUILD-READY" snapshot of a clean REMnux OVA.
Required installation files (such as the IDA Pro installer and ZIPs with GNOME extensions) are then copied into the guest VM.
The configuration file specifies the VM name, the exported VM name, and details for each snapshot.
Individual snapshot configurations include the extension, description, and custom commands to be executed within the guest.
