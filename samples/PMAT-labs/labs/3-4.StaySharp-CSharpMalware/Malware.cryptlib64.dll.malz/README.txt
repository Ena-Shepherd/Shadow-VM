Hey Analyst!

We found this DLL in Program Files on an endpoint. It was hidden in with one of the proprietary programs that the company uses in our payment processing departments. Thing is, the MACE attributes looked way off; the Created timestamp looks way too recent compared to when the program was installed. It seems unlikely but we suspect this might be malware.

Can you take a look?

Thanks,
SOC
