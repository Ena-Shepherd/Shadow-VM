Hey Analyst,

Can you take a look at this? We're scratching our heads because 1) none of the developers remember committing this, and 2) it says it's a Java updater and, and I cannot overstate this... this is a C# application.

Help?

Note: This sample is just source code, so it can be considered defanged for the purposes of handling. Still, be careful with the block of shellcode when you begin analysis; it could be anything.
