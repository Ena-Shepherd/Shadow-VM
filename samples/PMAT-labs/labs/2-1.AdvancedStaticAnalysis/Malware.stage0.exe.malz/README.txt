WE GOT ONE.

Take a look at the sample in this zip folder. It's definitely a dropper program, but we need you to break out the decompiler and debugger and take a closer look.

We know that it's trying to spawn a reverse shell and we got it to call back successfully to our fake listener, but we're wondering how it's actually working to do that exactly. Anything you can find will help us determine how it got here and how it works.
