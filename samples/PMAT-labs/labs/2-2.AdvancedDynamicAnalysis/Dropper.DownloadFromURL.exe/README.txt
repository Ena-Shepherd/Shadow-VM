Hi Analyst!

This is a sample from earlier; your initial analysis identified that this binary has the capability to download a file from a remote host and copy it to the file system.

Open this sample up with the decompiler/disassembler and take a closer look. Make sure to pay attention to the API calls and how they are being performed.
