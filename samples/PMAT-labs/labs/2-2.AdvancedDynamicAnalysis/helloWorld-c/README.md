# Hello, World! under a Microscope

Examine the two following executables. They are both identical and simple in terms of design. Both print "Hello, World!" to the console.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```

However, one of the binaries has `debug symbols` included and one has them stripped out.

## Safety Note
Both of these binaries are simple Hello, World! examples and are not held within password protected zip folders. There is no malicious functionality within either binary.
